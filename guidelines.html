	<h1>Guidelines for generating very short TREC queries</h1>

<b>Mark Sanderson and Ross Wilkinson</b>
<p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
TREC queries currently come in the form shown below: well thought out long information requests.  One could think of this form as being generated by trained professional search intermediaries.  When an IR system is used by untrained casual users, however, a different form of query is often submitted: a poorly thought out exceptionally short information request.  Queries of this form are becoming increasingly common.  At TREC-5, Dan Rose presented figures derived from the query logs of three publically available web based retrieval systems.  This showed that approximately 40% of queries submitted to these systems were one word queries and that ~90% of queries consisted of three words or less.
<p>
In the light of this and similar evidence, it was decided to create a set of very short queries for the TREC-6 experiments so that retrieval effectivness on this common query form can be studied.  The aim of this document is to provide guidance to the TREC query generating people on how to create these queries.
<p>

<p>
	<h2>What should these queries look like?</h2>
It was decided at TREC-5 that the title of a TREC query would suffice as the very short queries for TREC-6, though with one modification.  The average length of the titles used in TREC-5 is three non-stopwords (a stop word is the name given to words like determiners, pronouns, etc.) in length.  We would like the length of very short queries to be on average two non-stopwords.  Therefore, when generating this year's queries we would like you to make an effort in ensuring that the length of the titles is kept as short as possible.  Please try to keep the length of the title to between 1 and 3 non-stop words.  Only in exceptional circumstances would they be any longer, for example, if the title were some well known phrase or a long proper name.
<p>
Do not worry if the title is not an accurate expression of the information need, this is a common feature of very short queries: there is only so much that can be expressed in such a small number of words.
<p>
What follows is a table containing containing in the left column existing TREC queries and in the right column these queries in very short query form.

  &lttitle&gt Exportation of Industry
  
  <p>

  &ltdesc&gt Description: 
  <br>
  Documents will report the exportation of some part of U.S. Industry
  to another country.
  
  <p>

  &ltnarr&gt Narrative: 
  <br>
  Relevant documents will identify the type of industry being exported,
  the country to which it is exported; and as well will reveal the
  number of jobs lost as a result of that exportation.

  &lttitle&gt Topic: Non-invasive procedures for persons with
  heart ailments

  <p>

  &ltdesc&gt Description:
  <br>
  The document will discuss all those cases in which medications
  and procedures were used instead of or prior to heart surgery.

  <p>

  &ltnarr&gt Narrative:
  <br>
  A relevant document will report/discuss those cases in which persons
  diagnosed with heart ailments were treated with medications and/or
  techniques such as angioplasty, stents, lasers, arthrectomy
  (roto router) etc., in place of surgery.  Also advantages of
  non-invasive procedures over surgery and comparative studies which
  show any disparity in longevity when either procedure is used.

  &lttitle&gt Topic: Imposition of a school uniform or dress code

  <p>

  &ltdesc&gt Description:
  <br>
  The document will discuss the pros and cons of students wearing
  a school uniform or adhering to a dress code.

  <p>

  &ltnarr&gt Narrative:
  <br>
  A relevant document will report on the value or positive gains in
  schools which have a school uniform or dress code in terms of
  department and educational gains, positive gains, i.e., less crime
  and better scholastic achievement in schools which have recently
  adopted a uniform/dress code.  Alternatively the article could
  discuss the negative effects of school uniforms or dress codes.

  &lttitle&gt Topic: World submarine forces

  <p>

  &ltdesc&gt Description:
  <br>
  Determine the number of submarines, both nuclear-powered and
  conventional, presently in the inventories of all the countries
  in the world.

  <p>

  &ltnarr&gt Narrative:
  <br>
  We are looking for a count of operable submarines in any country
  that currently has a navy with submarines.  To be relevant a document
  should give a specific number of submarines, but not necessarily
  its entire fleet of submarines (although, that is our ultimate goal).
  A report of a French submarine suffering a mishap in the North sea
  would not be relevant.  However, a report of a new submarine being
  built in Shanghai that contains other valuable information, such as
  "this is the third reported unit constructed at this base" would be
  relevant.  Any information that would be considered useful as an
  intelligence tool in determining a country's submarine order of
  battle would be relevant.
