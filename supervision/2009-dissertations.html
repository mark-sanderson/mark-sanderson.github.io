		<h1>MS-1: Customising Google for Sheffield University</h1>
			
        <p>When I search on Google from the University of Sheffield, I want not only the main (organic) search results, I also want to see my search conducted on the University Library, Google Scholar, and some of the other databases that the University has subscriptions to. I want to do this, because, as good as Google is, it often doesn't inform me about other sources that I can get access to in the University. Last year, we ran a successful, though initial, student project to try to see what such a system might look like. A video of the system can be seen below.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        					<OBJECT CLASSID="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" CODEBASE="http://active.macromedia.com/flash5/cabs/swflash.cab#version=6,0,23,0" ID="demo.swf" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="509" VIEWASTEXT>
						<PARAM NAME="movie" VALUE="demo.swf">
						<PARAM NAME="quality" VALUE="high">
						<PARAM NAME="bgcolor" VALUE="#000000">
						<PARAM NAME="menu" VALUE="true">

					</OBJECT>
        <p>The look of the system output could be improved and the quality of search output from systems like the library  also needs to be better. I have a clear idea on how this can be achieved and I would like another MSc student to work on this topic once more. It is likely that we will have support of someone in the library to provide assistance on getting the SOAP access to their searching system working properly.</p>
        <p></p>

			<h1>MS-2 Studying geographic queries in Microsoft's search logs</h1>
			<p>We have a very large query and click log from a  large web search  engine (Microsoft's Live.com system).  The anonymised log consists of 12 million  queries and corresponding clicks. We've been analysing this log data  for a number of things, but there's plenty still to look at. One aspect  that would be very interesting to examine are geographic queries. I  worked with a Masters Student in Information Studies a few years ago who  did one of the first studies in this area (her work has now been cited nearly 50 times). We would take <a href="../publications/my_papers/GeoQueryAnalysis2004.pdf">the paper she and I wrote</a> from her work as a starting point, look at other more recent work and then start studying the logs in detail.</p>
			<p>The ways of processing this data can be defined by you, the file is in a .txt format, so any programming language could be used to examine it. Equally, loading the data into your favourite database and running a bunch of SQL commands would be another way to work on this set. This project is more about research than it is about programming.</p>
            <div class="date"></div>
			<h1>MS-3 Document genre detection</h1>
			<p>We have desktop search engines to find documents on our hard drive that have certain words in them, but what if you want to search for an all meeting agendas on your hard drive? What if you want to find all documents that look like an invoice? What this is, is document genre analysis. This is a topic that has been looked at quite a bit on the web (e.g. automaticaly detecting home pages, that sort of thing), but there has been less work in the area of genre detection for documents on your hard drive.</p>
			<p>However, a corpus of 6,000 documents has just been released on which one could do a little study. The <a href="http://www.krys-corpus.eu">KRYS I Corpus</a> for genre classification research has just been released and I think that an examination of it would be an excellent project for a strong student. We would get the corpus, take some off-the-shelf machine learning classifier and  study how well the classifier can spot document genres. Once trained, the classifier could be applied to other document collections.</p>
